# Interview Preparation

Everyone hates it, but when it comes to computer science, nothing beats interview preparation like keeping a decent repository as well as having incredible coding skills.

## Goal

I hope to use this repository to hold all of the code I develop while doing interview preparation. Additionally, I hope to do this consistently to see progress in my coding and solving problem abilities.

## Preparation

My preparation will start with [NeetCode](https://neetcode.io/) basics and 150 (a set of [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) problems). I hope that building the basic data structures will give me an understanding of the languages I choose to do it in as well as prepare me for solving other problems with code.

## Languages

I hope to do the basic data structures in a number of different languages, but for now I will stick to my most familiar language: Python. I might switch to C++ depending on if I want to practice pointers and more low-level programming skills.
